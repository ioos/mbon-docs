# Overview
_20 Years of Data_

**About this document**

CeNCOOS (<https://www.cencoos.org>) (Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System) working with the BeachCOMBERS 
program, aggregated beach cast surveys of marine mammals and seabirds from BeachCOMBERS, Beach Watch (<https://farallones.org/beach-watch>), 
and the Marine Mammal Stranding Program (<http://gsp.humboldt.edu/Projects/MMSP/Site1/aboutus.html>) at Cal Poly Humboldt. 
These data, when combined cover surveys from Del Norte County down to Los Angeles County for over 25 years. 
These data have been made available in the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network Data Portal (<https://mbon.ioos.us/>), which in 
addition to the COMBERS data, is jam packed with other marine data including data from moorings, satellite, R.O.V surveys, 
and oceanographic and atmospheric models. 

Here, we are going to walk through some of the tools in the portal and access some of the COMBERS data that many of you 
have helped collect. 

_Note: If you get lost or want to skip ahead, there are links to the portal along the way._



## Open the Data Portal
Note: The data portal works best using the Firefox and Chrome web browsers. 

The MBON Data Portal can be accessed by going to <https://mbon.ioos.us> The portal has two main components:
1. The Map Layer
2. The Data Catalog (which can also be accessed in the Map Layer)

To get to the **Catalog Layer** click on the **Search 270+ Datasets** button.

![](./img.png)

Now let’s search for the BeachCOMBERS data. This is part of the Data Layer named **Effort-based surveys, Northern and 
Central California Beaches: Seabirds and Marine Mammals**, but the **Data Catalog** is pretty smart and each dataset includes 
a set of tags that are used to classify different types of data. 

_Note: There are many advanced ways to filter queries in the **Data Catalog** that we won't be covering here, but can be 
accessed by selecting the **Advanced** button underneath the search bar_

![](./img_1.png)

Link to the Catalog Search interface: <https://mbon.ioos.us/#search?type_group=all&page=1>

## Add Data Layer to the map

Once we find the dataset we want (`Bird Carcasses` from **Effort-based surveys, Northern and Central California Beaches: 
Seabirds and Marine Mammals**), we can add it to the **Map Layer** by selecting **Add to map** button for the appropriate 
**Layer**. 

Here we also can read a narrative about the dataset, which includes a description of how different metrics are calculated as 
well as a link to the ISO metadata record for those who want to dive deeper.

## Navigating the Map Layer
Click on the Map Button.

Here we can visualize many types of data both spatially and temporally. 

Each different dataset is called a **Layer**. 

![](./img_3.png)

There is a lot going on here! Let’s focus on the blue **Navigation Header** at the top of the portal.


![](./img_4.png)

**There are nine Tabs here**:
1. **Home** - This takes you to the MBON Data Portal home page.
2. **Catalog** - This takes you to the Data Catalog.
3. **Map** -This will take you to the Map viewer. If any datasets have been added to the map, they will appear. 
4. **Data Views** -These are collections of plots from different Data Layers (we'll come back to this soon).
5. **Settings** - Here you can change things like the Units, color schemes, base layers for the map, and many other options.
6. **Share** -This will generate a unique url to what you are currently seeing in the portal. This can be shared with others or used to regenerate the portal in its current state. 
7. **Help** - Here you find links to the help documents and an interactive guide to the portal 
8. **Feedback** -This is a great way to report bugs, ask questions, or open a line of communication with us! We track all of the feedback and appreciate any comments.

## Exploring the Data 
Now let’s go back to the map by clicking on **Map** button.

![](./img_3.png)

It looks very busy, so let’s go over how to use the **Map**.

Currently, we have two data Layers loaded up. First the **bird carcass** layer and the **Global sensors** layer (See [Appendix for how to use this layer](#appendix-using-the-real-time-sensor-layer)).

In the meantime, let’s hide this layer. 

Under the **Legend** tab select the **eyeball icon with a slash** next to the title of the layer. Selecting this again 
will re-enable the layer.

![](./img_5.png)

**Zooming into Monterey Bay**

![](./img_6.png)

Zooming in the portal can be accomplished a couple of different ways:
1. The Plus and Minus Buttons
2. The Magnification Tool: Drag a rectangle over the region that you want to zoom to.
3. Zoom in/out with a scroll wheel or by doub1e clicking on a region.

Now that that is done, we should only be able to see **Seabird Carcass** surveys. Each color corresponds to a survey site.

![](./img_7.png)

Let change the default **measurement** to display the **Count** instead of **Carcasses per effort per km**. Click on the 
**Measurement** drop down menu in the Legend and select **Count**.

![](./img_8.png)

Now hover the mouse over a site and see what happens.

![](./img_9.png)

This is a sum off all of the most common Seabird Carcasses that has been found at this beach, as well as some metadata about the beach. 
We can also click on a site to see the time series of that site. Try it out!

![](./img_10.png)

## Filtering Data 
The portal has multiple ways to filter data: by time, by taxonomy, by collection group and more. 

In the Legend box select plus sign on the **Species (common name)** drop-down menus. This will give a list of the common 
names of different birds that were identified.

![](./img_11.png)

For more information about filtering by taxonomy and organization see [Appendix: Advanced Filtering](#appendix-advanced-filtering).

## Keyword Filtering 
There are some other really cool filtering feature, try selecting a Species using the common name. 

You can also use keywords to filter the data, try searching for `gull`.

![](./img_12.png)

Now when you hover over a site you can see that multiple species of `gull` are included in the filter.

![](./img_13.png)

Link to **Map View** filtered by `gull`: <https://mbon.ioos.us/?ls=_f6KAdsb#map>

## Polygon Selection

Select the polygon icon on the right-hand side of the page.

![](./img_14.png)

Now use that tool to draw a polygon around Monterey Bay. When you are done, double click on the polygon and this will 
extract a time series of all of the selected data.

![](./img_15.png)

Now let’s look at some specific mortality events and then include some environmental data from satellites. 

Using what the tools we just showed:
* **Filter** the data to just select `Common Murre`
* Use the **polygon selection tool** to select the beaches around `Monterey Bay` 
* Select a **measurement** of `Carcasses Per Km`

The results should be a time series plot that looks similar to this:

![](./img_16.png)

Let’s expand this plot by clicking on the Enlarge icon:

![](./img_17.png)

Now we can change how the data are binned through time. By default this dataset is binned into annual values, but we can 
also display the data for each month (the raw values) or by the season. 

Click on the **Time Bin** pull down and select **Months**.

![](./img_18.png)

From this plot a couple of things stand out:
1. There is a seasonal signal to Seabird Deposition - Fall and Summer tend to have higher deposition than Winter and Spring
2. There are three unusual events that stand out
   1. 1997: El Nino year, HASS, and Gill Net mortalities
   2. 2007: Starvation event
   3. 2015: The Blob: Marine Heatwave

## Adding/Comparing Sea Surface Temperature
Let's add the SST layer as measured from Satellites.

This can be found by searching the **Data Catalog** as shown earlier, but the data catalog can be easily accessed by 
selecting the **Find Data** next to the **Legend** in the Map Layer.

Now let’s search for `SST` and add the **GHRSST Level 4 MUR Global Foundation Sea Surface Temperature Analysis (.01deg/1km)** 
layer by selecting the blue cross next to the name.

[GIF of searching in map]

![](./img_19.png)

Now let’s create a **time series of SST in the middle of Monterey Bay**. This is done by creating a virtual sensor, a 
tool that extracts a time series at a single point out of a spatial dataset. This make take a second to load. 

[GIF adding SST to map]

![](./img_20.png)

Once it’s loaded, try to see if you can **expand** the plot of change around temporal binning.

![](./img_21.png)

_Tip: The portal has a ton of features and data. Feel free to poke around and try to break things!_

## TOPIC: Comparing Data with Data Views

_Note: If continuing from above, you will need to click the eyeball icon on the SST layer to **hide layer**._

Now we can create a **Data View** to view multiple types of data on the same page. The first **data view** will compare two beaches.
1. **Filter** the `Bird Carcasses` layer for `Common Murre`
2. Use the **polygon selection** to select the Monterey Bay region.
3. In the time series window, Select the **Measurement** of `counts per effort per km`
4. Create a new Data View by selecting the Blue Star button. Then select the Plus sign to create a new data view. Give it 
a name (we named it `Monterey Beaches` in the screenshot below).

   Then a check the two boxes to **Save to data view** and **Add to compare chart**

![](./img_22.png)

Now add SST time series to the `Monterey Beaches` **Data view** you just learned how to create from the middle of Monterey Bay.
See [Adding/Comparing Sea Surface Temperature](#addingcomparing-sea-surface-temperature).

_Note: If continuing from above, the SST layer should already be available as a **map layer**. You need to **show layer**
by selecting the eyeball icon to see it on the map._

Pick a point on the map to create your virtual station for the SST time series. Add that to the `Monterey Beaches` **Data view**.

![](./img_23.png)

Finally, let’s look at the **Data View**! This is done by selecting the **Data View** button near the top of the portal and 
selecting the data view you just created from the drop down menu (`Monterey Beaches`).

![](./img_24.png)

Here is the static link to the **Data View** we just created: <https://mbon.ioos.us/?ls=HwIUygJm#data/10>

## The Data View

![](./img_25.png)

There is a lot of information here, lets clean up some of these figures so we can more easily interpret what's going on.

For the **Comparison chart** you can add/remove the various statistics presented on the chart by clicking **Legend** and 
checking/unchecking the desired statistics. Notice how the comparison chart adds/removes those statistics as you check/uncheck 
the boxes. Lets remove the **Seasonal statistics** and the Observations **min/max envelope**.

![](./img_26.png)

You can also adjust the **time bin** to appropriately bin the observations through time.

![](./img_27.png)

After cleaning up the statistics and appropriately binning the observations, our **Data View** should look like this:

![](./img_28.png)


**Now let’s look at the SST data**

The mortality following the 2015 Warm Blob really stands out, as well as the seasonality of carcass deposition.

![](./img_29.png)


Let's see just how warm the winter months of 2014 were. In the **Saved Charts** section of the **Data View** we can also 
visualize SST as an anomaly or annual averages. Adjust the **Chart** to `Annual averages` and set the **Year** to `2015` 

![](./img_30.png)

Now, adjust the **Chart** to `Anomaly` and use your cursor to zoom into `2015`. Notice how warm 2015 was!

![](./img_31.png)

Go back to the **Comparison Chart** and adjust the time slider to only show data from 2015.

![](./img_32.png)

Here is the static link to the **Data View** we just created: <https://mbon.ioos.us/?ls=HwIUygJm#data/10>

## Finally: The Feedback Button
If you are having any trouble, something doesn't look right, or really anything else. Please use the **feedback** button in 
the top right of the portal. This button will send us a link to what you are looking at and help us figure out what is 
going on. It's also a great way for us to log suggestions, so if there is something you would like to see, we want to 
hear it!

![](./img_33.png)

## Appendix: Using the Real-time Sensor Layer
The colors that you see on the map correspond to a different parameter being measured at a given location. By default we 
are seeing **Air Temperature** and the color corresponds to the most recent value (gray if no values have reported in 24 hours).
Hovering over a circle will give us more information about the data stream and show some recent data.

![](./img_34.png)

Here is the link to the **Map View** with the Global Sensors layer added: <https://mbon.ioos.us/?ls=p4ZhOW1_#map>

## Appendix: Advanced Filtering
The portal has multiple ways to filter data: by time, by taxonomy, by collection group and more.
In the **Legend** box select plus sign on the **Advanced Icon**. This will expand the filtering options.

![](./img_35.png)

Now let’s select **BeachCOMBERS** from the **Organization Drop down Menu**.

Now if you zoom out on the map you will notice that it is only showing data collected by BeachCOMBERS.

![](./img_36.png)

Here is the link to the **Data View** of the **Bird Carcasses** data layer, filtered by **Organization** of `Beach Combers`: <https://mbon.ioos.us/?ls=n62ES453#map>
